Thesis Marketplace
==================

Class project for the Enterprise Software Architecture 2015-16 Course

## Vision

**For** students, professors and organizations,
**who** are interested in being involved in a thesis project,
**the** project ThesisMarket
**is a** bachelor and master thesis proposals marketplace
**that** allows them to propose thesis project, and also to get involved in proposals made by others, they are interested in.
**Unlike** current situation where proposals are periodically published in institutional web pages or proposed informally,
**our project** facilitates making proposals and contacting other parties interested in them.
